# STL-A-Star-Algorithm
This Project uses STL  to implement A* Search to find the minimum path between two cities given a map. The example is taken from the book AI: A Modern Approach, 3rd Ed., by Russel, where a map of Romania is given. The target node is Bucharest, and the user can specify the initial city from which the search algorithm will start looking for the minimum path to Bucharest.
